## <span class = 'green'>SillyAppy Always Looking For More TO DOs::<span>

* TO DO:: display table of dataframe
* TO DO:: would like to control the format here e.g. h3
* TO DO:: Would like to be able to import a file building on [this](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny-examples/tree/master/066-upload-file) then this would build the dropdown menus, and other options. that way it is more dynamic.
* TO DO:: Handle many different file formats/structures.
* TO DO:: More opions on the graphs to display.
